"I think, in the end, I like this slightly more than the Christopher Nolan picture. I got more out of it and thought the structural approach here worked better.",0.6597,Positive
لا أعلم بشأن أخلاقية هذا سأعلق بحياديةكان الوثائقي صورة متجردة لرجل أنجب ناراً لن يطفئها التاريخ.. عقلًا ممزقًا بين الاكتشاف والندم، بين العلم والضميرفي زمنٍ كان فيه الذكاء مرادفًا للقوة، يصبح أوبنهايمر مرآة لإنسانٍ اخترع نهايته بيديه، ثم وقف يتأملها بصمت..فعلًا العقول الأكثر ذكاءًا هي الأكثر ضعفا في وجه ما تصنعه,0.0,Neutral
Before watching the movie you must watch the series. Great political series which highlights how afraid the American government was well is still afraid of communism.,0.7351,Positive
"Watched over July 24-31.Almost impossibly, Nolan manages to cram far more story into his three hours then Davis does in his seven. Something, something, something, quantum physics, innit?It's fine, but why watch this when a shorter, far superior spectacle exists?",0.7587,Positive
"Sam Waterson softly saying that scientists shouldn't be involved in politics is more powerful than any of Nolan's loud noises, explosions and gimmicky flashforwards.",0.4754,Positive
Lengthy but comprehensive BBC version which I haven't seen again since it first aired. Waterson makes for a less anaemic looking titular scientist but still captures the weary and worn-out vibe of a man haunted by his creation and by the vindictive paranoia of an establishment that shamefully turned its back on him.,-0.8402,Negative
"I wanted to watch this mini series after seeing Nolan's Oppenheimer, I thought Sam Waterston was great, I'd hadn't seen much of his work when he was that young.",0.6249,Positive
"In the wake of Christopher Nolan's 2023 film, and their centenary, the BBC seemed to realise what a great wealth of culture they actually are, and have begun to make available some of their older work. Part of this includes their 1980 production, ""Oppenheimer"" a seven part biography on J. Robert Oppenheimer, starring Sam Waterston as the titular.Now, I'm a big fan of old television, but even I can admit when it's a bit of a slog. This mini-series…more",0.7579,Positive
"What absolutely amazes me is that seven hours of this didn’t really give me anything new that wasn’t done or touched on in Nolan’s film (just allowed some of those things to breathe more and not be restricted to Oppie’s pov) but also still didn’t include the Strauss hearing or college Oppie so Nolan really is some fucking timey wimey wizard to get all that in three hours.Anyways, if you’re one of those with the main complaint about needing it in chronological order then try this.",0.0099,Neutral

"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds""Seven part mini series detailing the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the man that guided the team that built the first Atom Bomb. Verdict....gripping well made drama covering a sensitive subject and a road in history that maybe the human race should not have taken!",-0.8516,Negative
