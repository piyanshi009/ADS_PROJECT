"After waiting an entire year—because I had chosen to watch Oppenheimer instead of Barbie at the cinema—I CAN FINALLY SAY IT WAS WORTH ALL THE ATTENTION.The movie felt so fine, so real, and so me.I’m honestly glad I watched it at 18, right at the end of my teenage years, just as I was about to turn 19.It spoke to me in a way I didn’t expect; it taught me so much, and I truly love it from the bottom of my heart.It opened my eyes to how “dad-rules” shape the world, and how things should be easier for us girls.",0.967,Positive
